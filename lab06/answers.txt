a) Which objects in the diagram instantiate which?
random_test instantiates env
Env instantiates tester, driver, uvm_tlm_fifo fifo, coverage, scoreboard, command_monitor and result monitor


b) The following objects in the diagram are created by the new() function:
uvm_tlm_fifo

c) The following objects in the diagram are created by reference to the UVM factory:
tester, driver, coverage, scoreboard, command_monitor, result_monitor

d) Objects of the following classes retrieve BFM information from UVM by calling uvm_config_db:
driver, result_monitor, command_monitor

e) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_analysis_port:
command_monitor, result_monitor

f) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_get_port:
driver

g) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_put_port:
random_tester

h) The following uvm_*_port classes are parametrized:
uvm_analysis_port #(command_s) ap
uvm_analysis_port #(shortint) ap
vm_get_port #(command_s) command_port
uvm_put_port #(command_s) command_port

i) The following classes include the implementation of the void write() method:
scoreboard, coverage
