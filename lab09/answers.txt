A. List the three differences between the driver classes of Exercise 7 (using transactions) and the exemplary driver class (using sequences).

Driver which uses sequences inherits from parametrized uvm_driver.
In new driver there is no fifo, just sequencer_item_port.
We begin one transaction during which we are sending sequences instead of few transactions.

B. In the new UVM environment with a sequencer (env_h), which testbench elements should be modified when adding a new test? (We consider the testbench elements the env and the hierarchy below.)

You don't have to change anything. You have to add new test_name in run_xrun and include it in _pkg
