a) The following testbench objects will communicate with each other using transactions:

command monitor to coverage and scoreboard
result monitor to scoreboard

b) The minimum number of transaction classes needed to run a single test (e.g. random_test) is: 1


c) The objects that create the instances of these transactions are:

tester creates command_transaction instances
result_monitor creates result_transaction instances

d) How many new transaction classes do we need to add if we create a new test (e.g., add_test) so that the add_test inherits from random_test? 1


d) If we have two tests, e.g. random_test and minmax_test, and one tester, how are different transaction
types generated for different tests (i.e. random_command for random_test, and minmax_command for
minmax_test)? 

different transactions are generated using the same same base transaction which type is overridden by other transaction classes
